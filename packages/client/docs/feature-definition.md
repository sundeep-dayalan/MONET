# What is a Feature?

In the context of this project, a **feature** is a cohesive grouping of logic, UI, hooks, types, utilities, and configurations that implement a relevant behavior or capability for the user or product domain. A feature may include pages, components, hooks, providers, layouts, and other artifacts, all organized in a dedicated folder under `src/features/[name]/`.

## What can be a Feature?

- An authentication flow (login, registration, password recovery)
- A dashboard or control panel
- A notification system
- A user management module
- A content editor
- Any functionality that has its own logic, UI, and/or state and can be evolved independently

## Questions to Decide if Something Should Be a Feature

1. **Does this solve a problem or deliver direct value to the user?**
2. **Can it be developed, tested, and evolved independently?**
3. **Does it involve multiple components, hooks, types, or utilities?**
4. **Does it have its own business logic or state?**
5. **Could it be reused in other parts of the system?**
6. **Is it a complete flow or module (not just an isolated component)?**
7. **Does it require configuration, API integration, or its own state management?**

## People Usually Involved in the Decision

- Product Owner / Product Analyst
- Tech Lead / Software Architect
- Frontend Developers
- UX/UI Designer (when user experience is involved)
- QA (to assess impact on tests and coverage)
