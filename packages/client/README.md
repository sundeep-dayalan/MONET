## ⚙️ Code Generation

[🔝 Back to Index](#-index)

Easily scaffold new components or features with:

```bash
npm run generate
```

### 📂 Component Structure

```bash
src/components/[type]/[name]/
│── [name].tsx            # Component view
│── [name].spec.tsx       # Unit test
│── [name].module.scss    # Styles (scoped)
│── [name].types.ts       # Types & interfaces
│── [name].view-model.ts  # View-model / logic
│── index.ts              # Public exports
```

* **\[type]** → `element`, `provider`, `page`, or `layout`
* **\[name]** → The component name

### 📂 Feature Structure

```bash
src/features/[name]/
│── index.tsx             # Feature entry point
│── components/           # UI components
│   ├── elements/         # Basic UI (buttons, inputs, etc.)
│   ├── providers/        # Complex providers / data UI
│   ├── pages/            # Full pages / screens
│   └── layouts/          # Layout containers
│── hooks/                # Custom hooks
│── types/                # Types & interfaces
│── utils/                # Utilities
│── config/               # Configurations
```

### 📂 SubComponent Structure

```bash
src/components/[type]/[parent-name]/components/[subcomponent-name]/
│── [name].tsx            # Subcomponent view
│── [name].spec.tsx       # Unit test
│── [name].module.scss    # Styles (scoped)
│── [name].types.ts       # Types & interfaces
│── [name].view-model.ts  # View-model / logic
│── index.ts              # Public exports
```

* **[subcomponent-name]** → The subcomponent name
> The same structure applies to subcomponents within feature modules.  
> For example, if a feature contains its own nested components, organize them using the same conventions as shown above for subcomponents. This ensures consistency and maintainability across both global and feature-scoped components.

## ❓ FAQ

[🔝 Back to Index](#-index)

### What is the minimum Node.js version required?
Node.js version 16 or higher is required. Using the latest LTS version is recommended for better stability and support.

### Can I use npm instead of npm run?
Yes, but using `npm run` is recommended for consistency and to ensure compatibility with the predefined scripts in the project.

### How do I add a new feature or component?
Use the code generation tool by running:
```bash
npm run generate
```
Follow the prompts to scaffold the desired feature or component.

### How do I configure environment variables?
Create a `.env` file in the root directory and define your variables there. Use the `example.env` file as a reference.

### How do I update dependencies?
Run the following command to update all dependencies:
```bash
npm update
```
For major version updates, review the changelogs of the respective packages to ensure compatibility.

### How do I report a bug or request a feature?
Open an issue on the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/luciancaetano/startercraft/issues) with detailed information about the bug or feature request.
